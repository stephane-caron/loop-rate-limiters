"""Non-blocking loop frequency limiter for asyncio.

Note that there is a difference between a (non-blocking) rate limiter and a
(blocking) synchronous clock, which lies in the behavior when skipping cycles.
A rate limiter does nothing if there is no time left, as the caller's rate does
not need to be limited. On the contrary, a synchronous clock waits for the next
tick, which is by definition in the future, so it always waits for a non-zero
duration.

    Calls to :func:`sleep` are non-blocking most of the time but become

    This rate limiter is in essence the same as in the one from pymanoid_. It
    relies on the event loop time never jumping backwards nor forwards, so that
    it does not handle such cases contrary to e.g. rospy.Rate_.
